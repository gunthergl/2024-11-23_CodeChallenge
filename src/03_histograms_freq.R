#' Results:
#'   - Area:
#'       - 6 levels.
#'          Probably connected to "Region", I think that "Region" is a sub-level of "Area"
#'       - Visibly low amounts of Area "F", Most "C"
#'  - VehBrand:
#'      - 11 levels.
#'      - B1, B2 and B12 are almost identical in prevalence, far off B3, almost no B14.
#' - VehGas:
#'    - 2 levels: Regular + Diesel.
#'    - Almost identical prevalence.
#' - Region:
#'    - Many levels, heavily skewed. R24 most common, R43 least common.

# Check if Region is a sub-level of Area:
print(df_freq |> dplyr::select(Area, Region) |> dplyr::distinct() |> dplyr::arrange(Region, Area))
print(df_freq |> dplyr::select(Area, Region) |> dplyr::distinct() |> dplyr::arrange(Area), n = 1000)

#  3 C     R11
#  4 D     R11
#  5 E     R11
#  6 F     R11
# --> No, Region is not a sub-level of Area, nor vice-versa.

#' Results:
#'  BonusMalus:
#'    - Most have 50, then slightly right-skewed. Probably low number of very high (~250) outliers.
#'  - ClaimNb: Number of claims.
#'     - Most have 0 claims, then 2, then 3 claims. 4+ claims are very rare.
#'     - Only 16 IDpol have 4+ claims.
#'  - Density: Number of people per km2.
#'     - Why are there so many with very low density?
#'     - Right-skewed, most have very low density.
#'     - Visible peak at high density; Probably city areas
#' - DrivAge: Age of the driver.
#'     - Slightly right-skewed.
#'     - From histogram is looks like there is a hole at ~40 years? Confirm in detailed.
#' - Exposure: Length of the insurance period.
#'    - Two visible peaks; one around 0.1, one around 1. Very few have more than 1. Detailed!
#' - IDpol: ID of the policy.
#'   - Does almost seem normally distributed, is there a structure behind?

#' Result:
#' - BonusMalus: Some very high outliers. I have to identify how to calculate with BonusMalus - french Schadenfreiheitsrabatt. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonus%E2%80%93malus
#' - ClaimNb; the log-plot looks well. It looks nice but note that some bars are missing because there is only count=1 for some values.
#'   - Density: Log-plot still looks right-skewed. Interesting that most have very low densities, how is this possible?
#' - DrivAge:
#'     - There is NO hole at any year. The hole was just a visual artifact.
#'     - Why is there noone above 100 years? Is this a data error?
#'     - Why are there 70 exactly 99 years old drivers? Surprisingly many, potentially this is the maximum number insertable in the entry system?
#' - Exposure:
#'    - There are only 181 unique values. This is very low. I have to check if this is a data error or if this is intended.
#'    - Comparably low number of exposure >1.
#'    - There are some values with exposure=0. This is not possible, I have to check if this is a data error or if this is intended.
#' - VehAge:
#'   - The range is from 0 to 100 years.
#'   - There seems to be a gap between 85 and 99+100 years. Notable data entry thing?
#'   - Number of cars decreasing until ~40 years, then similar until ~50, then drop heavily and only <10 cars.
#'   - The number of cars with 99 and 100 years is very high. This is something special. Oldtimer?
#' - VehPower:
#'    - The range is from 4 to 15.
#'    - log(n) plot is decreasing towards vehicle power, but almost uniform. -->LogUniform distribution?

# Calculate the number of days per exposure. Unclear how a "year" is defined.
# I think it is 365 days, because with 365 we get exactly
# 1, 2 and 3 days as well as 0.997, 1.994 and 2.992 days. (So, "almost" each of the first days. )
